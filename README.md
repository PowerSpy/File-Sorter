# File Sorting Script

This Python script organizes files within a specified directory based on their extensions. It offers options to sort files into separate folders by extension or organize them alongside existing folders.

## Usage

1. **Provide Target Directory**: Enter the directory path where the files are located.

2. **Sorting Method**:
   - If you choose to sort files by extension (Y/Yes), files will be grouped into folders based on their file extensions.
   - If you choose not to sort files by extension (N/No), files will either be organized into folders alongside existing folders or directly in the target directory.

3. **Confirmation**:
   - Confirm whether you want to proceed with sorting the files.

4. **Folder Management**:
   - After sorting files, you have options to manage leftover folders:
     - Delete all leftover folders.
     - Move all leftover folders into a new folder.
     - Take no action on leftover folders.

## Example Usage

```bash
python main.py
```
